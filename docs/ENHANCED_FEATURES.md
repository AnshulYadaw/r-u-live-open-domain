- Community: support, needs-triage, community-health
- Status: approved, deployed, archived
```

## 📊 Metadata and Analytics

### Request Tracking
Each processed request generates comprehensive metadata:
```yaml
{
  "issue_number": 123,
  "subdomain": "example",
  "record_type": "A",
  "target": "192.0.2.1",
  "requester": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "processing_time": 1642680000,
  "auto_processed": true,
  "validation_passed": true,
  "warnings": ["Private IP detected"]
}
```

### Abuse Report Tracking
```yaml
{
  "reported_subdomain": "suspicious",
  "report_issue": 456,
  "detected_types": ["malware", "phishing"],
  "reported_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "owner_info": {...},
  "status": "under_review"
}
```
